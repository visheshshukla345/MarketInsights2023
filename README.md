# MarketInsights2023
Unravelling Financial Dynamics through Statistical Analysis and Prediction Modelling. Utilized Yahoo Finance library for reliable data acquisition and preprocessing, empowering investors with actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

# Project  Overview

This report presents a comprehensive inquiry into the financial performance of four prominent companies  from 4 different industries each throughout the year 2023. Employing rigorous statistical techniques and robust data analysis, this study endeavors to address pivotal questions crucial for informed investment decisions. Through meticulous examination, I seek to unravel the intricacies of stock market dynamics, shedding light on key metrics such as stock price evolution, daily return averages, moving averages, inter-stock correlations, and risk assessment. 

Furthermore, I aim to extend the boundaries of knowledge by exploring advanced predictive methodologies, particularly focusing on the application of Long Short-Term Memory 
(LSTM) models, FeedForward Neural Network and ARIMA model to forecast future stock behaviors. As a practical demonstration, we present a predictive model tailored to anticipate the closing price of multiple stock. 

This analysis is structured to provide a comprehensive overview of our methodology, findings, and implications. It serves as a scholarly contribution to finance, offering insights that can inform academic discourse and guide practical investment strategies. Through our rigorous analysis, we contribute to a deeper understanding of financial markets and empower stakeholders with actionable insights. 

# Objectives

Through rigorous statistical analysis and data-driven methodologies, this study seeks to address the following key inquiries regarding the financial performance of four finance companies over the entirety of 2023: 
1. What are the patterns and trends in the change of stock prices over time for the selected companies?
2. What is the average daily return of the stocks, and how does it vary across the companies studied?
3. How do moving averages reflect and elucidate the performance trends of the various stocks?
4. What is the correlation between different stocks, and how does it impact diversification strategies?
5. How can the risk associated with investing in a particular stock be quantified and assessed?
6. Can future stock behavior be predicted, and to what extent can prediction models assist in forecasting the closing price of a stock?

These research questions serve as the guiding framework for our comprehensive analysis, aiming to provide nuanced insights into the financial dynamics of the selected companies and inform investment decision-making processes. 

# Dataset Description 

The dataset utilized in this study comprises one year of stock price data for 16 prominent financial firms from 5 different industries, sourced directly from Yahoo Finance through Yahoo Finance library. The dataset has been meticulously collected and cleaned, ensuring its reliability and accuracy for analysis purposes. 

Data Source: Yahoo Finance library
Timeframe: One year
Companies Included: 
A] Finance Indurstry: Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase.
B] Entertainment Industry: Netflix, Disney, Paramount and Comcast.

# Repository Structure

The project is structured into three distinct parts. As previously noted, our analysis encompasses four diverse industries: Entertainment, Finance, Technology, and Energy. Specifically, I conducted separate analyses for the Entertainment and Finance sectors using Julia and Python, respectively. Subsequently, I delved into the analysis of Technology and Energy sector stocks using R programming.
