Unravelling Financial Dynamics through Statistical Analysis and Prediction Modelling. Utilized Yahoo Finance library for reliable data acquisition and preprocessing, empowering investors with actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

# Project  Overview

This report presents a comprehensive inquiry into the financial performance of four prominent companies  from 4 different industries each throughout the year 2023. Employing rigorous statistical techniques and robust data analysis, this study endeavors to address pivotal questions crucial for informed investment decisions. Through meticulous examination, I seek to unravel the intricacies of stock market dynamics, shedding light on key metrics such as stock price evolution, daily return averages, moving averages, inter-stock correlations, and risk assessment. 

Furthermore, I aim to extend the boundaries of knowledge by exploring advanced predictive methodologies, particularly focusing on the application of Long Short-Term Memory 
(LSTM) models, FeedForward Neural Network and ARIMA model to forecast future stock behaviors. As a practical demonstration, we present a predictive model tailored to anticipate the closing price of multiple stock. 

This analysis is structured to provide a comprehensive overview of our methodology, findings, and implications. It serves as a scholarly contribution to finance, offering insights that can inform academic discourse and guide practical investment strategies. Through our rigorous analysis, we contribute to a deeper understanding of financial markets and empower stakeholders with actionable insights. 

# Objectives

Through rigorous statistical analysis and data-driven methodologies, this study seeks to address the following key inquiries regarding the financial performance of four finance companies over the entirety of 2023: 
1. What are the patterns and trends in the change of stock prices over time for the selected companies?
2. What is the average daily return of the stocks, and how does it vary across the companies studied?
